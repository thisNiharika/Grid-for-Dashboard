# Grid-for-Dashboard

It is a dashboard grid with 5 equal-sized rows. Four of them are divided into 2 sub-rows; the bootstrap class used is "short-div" and the 5th is a comparatively bigger row. It is made only with HTML and CSS.
The library used for the icon is https://ionic.io/ionicons which is completely free and can be used through a script tag.

Hope it helps!
